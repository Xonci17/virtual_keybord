## Introduction

This project implements a virtual keyboard using hand gesture recognition. The program uses a webcam to detect hand gestures and maps them to specific keys on the virtual keyboard. This allows users to type by simply moving their hand in front of the camera.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- CVZone (`pip install cvzone`)
- pynput (`pip install pynput`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies

## Usage

1. Run the program:

2. Place your hand in front of the webcam, and your hand movements will be recognized as keystrokes on the virtual keyboard.

3. To type a key, move your thumb and forefinger close to the corresponding button on the keyboard display.
